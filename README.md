Repository for storing code for my Pace University course CS675 Introduction To Data Science.

## Project 1
In this project, the task was to perform an EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) on a dataset of customer churn in the telecommunications industry. I inspected the raw dataset, cleaned it, and examined each of the variables and their relationships to each other, in order to predict the variables that affect churning of customers (churn is when customers leave the company).
